  description:
    <p>As mobile devices become more powerful and our reliance on these devices makes them a daily necessity, the Portable Power Max provides a giant 16,000 mAh power boost in one simple-to-use package that ensures your devices will never run out of power throughout the busy day or night.</p>
    <p>Now you can connect up to 5 USB-powered devices and charge them together using one backup power source (enough for the entire family) or charge each device separately. Put the Portable Power Max to work and you’ll have enough power to charge an iPad two complete times — that’s an additional 20 hours viewing time! Or charge an iPhone 4/4S up to 11 times, iPhone 3G 14 times, an iPod touch 18 times — the capacity is outstanding and the footprint is small&#59; the entire unit measures only 3.25" x 5.75" x 1" and weighs less than a pound.</p>
