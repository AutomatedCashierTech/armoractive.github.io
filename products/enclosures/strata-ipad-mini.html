    <p>Space Tested! The ArmorActive Labs have been hard at work, and we are excited to have one of our sleek and sexy Strata iPad mini enclosures; with security built into the design, the iPad mini lock enclosure was built to protect your iPad mini from theft or tampering. With the smaller screen, users are more excited than ever to look for ways to integrate iPad mini enclosures with this revolutionary technology. From digital signage to email collection, the iPad mini enclosure opens a plethora of avenues previously untraveled due to the size of the iPad minis big brother. Our iPad mini comes with 75mm and 100mm VESA mounting and custom branding options.</p>
