  need: Trade Shows are a great way to showcase product but they can also be easy to disappear into the crowd. GoPro was in search of a way to stand out and provide some incentives to booth patrons.
  description: Everyone wants to get to know their customer base better, and most retailers are happy to reward clients for helping them to gather this information. At the GoPro booth at this years Outdoor Retailer Show, and other trade shows throughout the summer, GoPro sported several iPad kiosks set up to help gather this info. Using a floor standing iPad kiosk and a wall mounted Tilt and Swivel arm they had two areas where customers signing up for an email newsletter were entered to win a free GoPro Hero3, the all new camera from GoPro. This was just one of many ways retailers are using iPad kiosks to gather and provide information to their customers, for more stories click here.
