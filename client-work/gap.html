  need: Gap Inc. needed a way to Inform participants at their 2012 Field Leadership Conference of new resources and programs at their disposal and introduce real time store applications to be used by store GMs.
  description: During the conference, ArmorActive specialists set up and fully managed 12 iPad kiosks, moving them throughout the Bellagio event rooms and formatting content to compliment activities. From registration to the final day of the conference, the kiosks were staged to make a clear impact on event participants. The iPads provided everything from event schedule information to entertaining video content displays, including a power point presentation covering over 40 years of brand history as well as a looped blast-from-the-past montage video of several memorable GAP TV commercials.
