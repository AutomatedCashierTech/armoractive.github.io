  name: Foot Locker
  need: Foot Locker needed a way to display their customer interaction iPads in a secure way that would also support Foot Locker’s branding and corporate image in their New Haven Mall store in Lake Grove, NY.
  description: Within only three weeks after the Foot Locker request, ArmorActive had designed, manufactured, and shipped the Strata enclosures per Foot Locker’s specifications. With the Strata iPad kiosks mounted to existing retail shoe wall racks, customers can now browse the key features of each shoe, as well as search for products that may only be available at other locations. With the success of the Strata, Foot Locker’s goal is to eventually deploy 4-5 iPad kiosks to each of their 3,000 stores nationwide.
