  name: Operation Smile
  need: Operation Smile needed a way to display iPads in an attractive and secure way for VIPs to use to make donations during the Park City Smile Event 2012.
  description: iPad Enclosures is proud to have donated their staff, time, kiosk hardware and software to Operation Smile’s Park City Smile Event 2012. The event was held March 30-31 and was chaired by Access Hollywood’s Billy Bush and NBC President Jennifer Salke. The iPad kiosks made it simple for Operation Smile to communicate their message and receive immediate feedback and support, to the tune of over $200,000 in surgeries and treatments for 800 children in need. Both iPad Enclosures and Operation Smile are excited to continue their partnership and look forward to organizing similar events in the future.
