Most major retail industries are embracing kiosk technology. Designed to help
increase revenue, retail kiosks are investments that pays off over a relatively
short period of time. Why? Because kiosks that are placed in strategic locations
offer eye-catching messages, attracting more customers and helping retailers
build a recognizable brand identity.

Retailers will see several benefits upon implementing a kiosk, including:

* __Customer Experience__ – Kiosks can be used to help aid customers in making
  purchasing decisions. In retail establishments, customers can inquire about
  pricing, compare features and even find out availability. By incorporating
  the latest technology into the general customer buying experience, retailers
  can help provide a more enjoyable in-person buying experience.
* __Customer Base__ – Tablet kiosk enclosures can greatly expand a retailer’s
  customer base. Instead of expanding with a building, which requires
  significant overhead expenses, retailers can test markets in certain areas
  prior to making long-term, costly investments. Interactive kiosks are
  cost-effective marketing strategies to help build strong customer bases.
* __Decreased Expenses__ – Allowing retailers to focus their employment
  personnel towards the sales industry, kiosks can help replace general customer
  service departments. Fewer employees’ means less managers, helping companies
  further save money in today’s downturned economy.
* __Efficiency__ – Interactive tablet enclosures are extremely versatile,
  helping companies’ process credit applications, job applications, gift
  registries, gift cards, loyalty programs and much more. Customers that use
  interactive kiosks generally report a significantly higher level of customer
  satisfaction, as it allows them to work through the aforementioned items at
  their own pace.
* __Job Satisfaction__ – Overhead doesn’t help companies generate sales, which
  is why it’s important for retailers to focus on expanding their sales forces.
  This also benefits employees, as more profitable companies are able to
  compensate employees with better salaries and benefits. Retailers can easily
  use kiosks for human resources issues, allowing employees to privately manage
  benefits packages and stay up-to-date on all company policies.
