Popping up in restaurants around the U.S., tablet kiosks are helping restaurants
provide excellent customer service. These secure kiosks are used for a variety
of day-to-day tasks, including offering digital menus, table-side orders,
catering orders, loyalty card stations, self-service payment terminals and even
social media.

Highlighted below are the top tablet kiosk trends:

* __Digital Signage__ – Whether it’s a wall mount, freestanding or counter
  model, tablet kiosks can be customized to restaurant spaces. Since tablets are
  small, it allows restaurants to place them in effective  locations, ultimately
  attracting customers’ attention. High-traffic locations are especially
  successful, as they allow restaurants to capture customers’ attention. Still
  graphics and videos can help make menus appear  mouthwatering, while
  highlighting specials. These kiosks can also display nutritional information,
  as well as options for customers on special  diets.
* __Loyalty Programs__ – By adding a mag-stripe reader, customers can easily use
  their loyalty cards, rewarding frequent customers for repeat business. With a
  freestanding tablet kiosk, it’s easy for customers to sign-up or check-in.
  With self-service access to loyalty programs and  rewards, customers are
  encouraged to frequently update information.
* __Photo Booth__ – To help engage customers with social media, restaurants
  should consider adding a photo booth app that allows customers to capture
  their location and share it with friends. This helps boost  social media
  advertisements for restaurants, while simultaneously pleasing customers’
  need to tweet or Facebook their statuses.
* __Table-Side Ordering__ – Instead of having customers feel pressured into
  ordering wine or dessert, table-side tablets allow customers to access
  restaurant menus for wine lists, desserts and menus.
* __Catering Orders__ – Excellent for processing catering orders, customers can
  browse sample menus, complete request forms and enter all necessary
  information for a catering event.
* __Self-Serve__ – It’s proven that more customers prefer to order themselves,
  meaning that tablet kiosks are perfect for complicated  restaurant orders,
  including detailed sub sandwich toppings, etc. In fact, self-service kiosks
  actually help speed up the ordering process, reduce overall errors and
  mistakes and actually help restaurants lower labor costs. With the added
  convenience of bill payment with restaurant POS software, customers are more
  in control of the ordering process.
