The wave of the future is here and statistics show that tablet kiosks are
helping companies boost sales and generate revenues. Whether Apple knew their
breakthrough iPad would revolutionize the world of computers to this extent is
unknown, but their landmark tablet debut has forever changed the business
industry.

The dawn of mobile computing is just beginning. Before the tablet, computers
were connected via wires. Even laptops had a mouse or a keyboard, which required
a flat work surface area. However, unlike traditional bulky desktop computers,
tablets combine the ultimate portability with the power of a laptop or personal
computer. When the iPad was introduced, many people thought it was too good to
be true. As recreational techie enthusiasts jumped on the iPad bandwagon,
businesses soon followed suit, seeing the numerous benefits of having a
versatile and mobile computing product at their fingertips.

Instead of creating a guarded relationship, such as those formed by a
traditional computer that requires a mouse and keyboard, a touch screen tablet
embraces intimate technology. Users can swipe, tap and pinch, giving them
ultimate control over their viewing experiences.

So how can businesses put this powerful product to use?

* __Customer Service__ – Free up customer service reps for more complicated
  tasks by allowing customers to choose interactive kiosks for simple,
  day-to-day questions and answers.
* __Feedback__ – Instead of completing follow-up emails or phone calls, have
  customers complete an interactive feedback survey immediately. Once customers
  leave a business, the chances of them participating in a survey greatly
  decrease, meaning that companies lose valuable feedback.
* __Entertainment__ – A perfect solution while checking customers’ credit or
  references, this lengthy time period can be filled by offering a tablet with
  the latest games and entertainment.
* __Assistance__ – Instead of sales people running back and forth to answer
  questions, having all answers on a tablet is more professional and wastes less
  of customers’ time.
* __Store Operations__ – It’s important for different groups within companies to
  effectively communicate, as this gives a cohesive public impression and
  appearance. To best facilitate making sure all employees are on the same page,
  companies should consider posting frequent updates, such as store hours,
  out-of-stock items, promotions, etc.
* __Signage__ – A tablet mount can be used to help post critical signage in
  areas that customers frequent. This can also include advertisements.
* __Schedules__ – For sales people that rely on conference rooms, it’s best to
  refer to a digital schedule to maintain an air of professionalism and not
  interrupt colleagues.
* __Education__ – Sales videos and technical manuals can easily be viewed on a
  tablet.
